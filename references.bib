Speciﬁcally, we formulate solutions for the task of optimal high-resolution sampling, counterparts of well-known results for high-rate quantization. Our results reveal that the optimal high-resolution sampling structure is determined by the density of the signal-gradient energy, just as the probability density function deﬁnes the optimal high-rate quantization form. This paper has three main contributions: The ﬁrst is establishing a fundamental paradigm bridging the topics of sampling and quantization. The second is a theoretical analysis of nonuniform sampling, for arbitrary signal dimension, relevant to the emerging ﬁeld of high-resolution signal processing. The third is a new practical approach to nonuniform sampling of one-dimensional signals that enables reconstruction based only on the sampling time points and the signal extrema locations and values. Experiments for signal sampling and coding showed that our method outperforms an optimized tree-structured sampling technique.},

	abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R–R interval – the heart period, has become a popular clinical and investigational tool. The temporal ﬂuctuations in heart rate exhibit a marked synchrony with respiration (increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration – the so called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) and are widely believed to reﬂect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation. Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease. It is the purpose of this essay to provide an historical overview of the evolution in the concept of HRV. Brieﬂy, pulse rate was ﬁrst measured by ancient Greek physicians and scientists. However, it was not until the invention of the “Physician’s Pulse Watch” (a watch with a second hand that could be stopped) in 1707 that changes in pulse rate could be accurately assessed. The Rev. Stephen Hales (1733) was the ﬁrst to note that pulse varied with respiration and in 1847 Carl Ludwig was the ﬁrst to record RSA. With the measurement of the ECG (1895) and advent of digital signal processing techniques in the 1960s, investigation of HRV and its relationship to health and disease has exploded. This essay will conclude with a brief description of time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear dynamic analysis techniques (and their limitations) that are commonly used to measure HRV.},

              Clustering has been an area of intensive research for several decades because of its multifaceted applications in innumerable domains. Clustering can be either Boolean, where a single data point belongs to exactly one cluster, or fuzzy, where a single data point can have nonzero belongingness to more than one cluster. Traditionally, optimization of some well‐defined objective function has been the standard approach in both clustering and fuzzy clustering. Hence, researchers have investigated the utility of evolutionary computing and related techniques in this regard. The different approaches differ in their choice of the objective function and/or the optimization strategy used. In particular, clustering using genetic algorithms (GAs) has attracted attention of researchers, and has been studied extensively. This paper presents a short review of some of different approaches of GA‐based clustering methods. Two techniques, one with fixed number of clusters and another with a variable number of fuzzy clusters, are described along with some experimental results on numerical as well as image data sets. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Clustering time-series data has been used in diverse scientific areas to discover patterns which empower data analysts to extract valuable information from complex and massive datasets. In case of huge datasets, using supervised classification solutions is almost impossible, while clustering can solve this problem using unsupervised approaches. In this research work, the focus is on time-series data, which is one of the popular data types in clustering problems and is broadly used from gene expression data in biology to stock market analysis in finance.

To obtain low-dimensional, parsimonious measures from this functional parameter, applied researchers consider collapsed measures of power within local bands that partition the frequency space. Frequency bands commonly used in the scientiﬁc literature were historically derived, but they are not guaranteed to be optimal or justiﬁed for adequately summarizing information from a given time series process under current study. There is a dearth of methods for empirically constructing statistically optimal bands for a given signal. The goal of this article is to provide a standardized, unifying approach for deriving and analyzing customized frequency bands. A consistent, frequency-domain, iterative cumulative sum based scanning procedure is formulated to identify frequency bands that best preserve nonstationary information. A formal hypothesis testing procedure is also developed to test which, if any, frequency bands remain stationary. The proposed method is used to analyze heart rate variability of a patient during sleep and uncovers a reﬁned partition of frequency bands that best summarize the time-varying power spectrum.

The approach can be used in fully nonparametric analyses or in semiparametric analyses that account for exogenous information and time-varying covariates. An estimation procedure is formulated within a penalized reduced-rank regression framework that provides estimates of layers that are interpretable as power localized within time blocks and frequency bands.

Preliminary analyses of our data suggest two statistical challenges. First, the variance at each channel and cross-covariance between each pair of channels evolve over time. Moreover, the cross-covariance proﬁles display a common structure across all pairs, and these features consistently appear across all trials. In the light of these features, we develop a novel evolutionary factor model (EFM) for multi-channel EEG data that systematically integrates information across replicated trials and allows for smoothly time-varying factor loadings. The individual EEGs series share common features across trials, thus, suggesting the need to pool information across trials, which motivates the use of the EFM for replicated time series. We explain the common co-movements of EEG signals through the existence of a small number of common factors. These latent factors are primarily responsible for processing the visual–motor task which, through the loadings, drive the behavior of the signals observed at diﬀerent channels. The estimation of the time-varying loadings is based on the spectral decomposition of the estimated time-varying covariance matrix.},

The proposed approach uses a Bayesian sum of trees model to capture complex dependencies and interactions between covariates and the power spectrum, which are often observed in studies of biomedical time series. Local power spectra corresponding to terminal nodes within trees are estimated nonparametrically using Bayesian penalized linear splines. The trees are considered to be random and fit using a Bayesian backfitting Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that sequentially considers tree modifications via reversiblejump MCMC techniques. For high-dimensional covariates, a sparsity-inducing Dirichlet hyperprior on tree splitting proportions is considered, which provides sparse estimation of covariate effects and efficient variable selection. By averaging over the posterior distribution of trees, the proposed method can recover both smooth and abrupt changes in the power spectrum across multiple covariates. Empirical performance is evaluated via simulations to demonstrate the proposed method’s ability to accurately recover complex relationships and interactions. The proposed methodology is used to study gait maturation in young children by evaluating age-related changes in power spectra of stride interval time series in the presence of other covariates.},

[Subjects] Ten healthy young individuals, ten community-dwelling elderly individuals and nine individuals with Parkinson’s disease were recruited. [Methods] To quantitatively evaluate stride-to-stride variability, we used fast Fourier transform, calculated the power spectrum, and separated it into three frequency ranges. We plotted a double-log graph for the power spectrum and calculated the slope of the line using least-squares regression. For each of the participants we measured 10-meter walking speed, stride-to-stride variability, and disease severity (only Parkinson’s disease). [Results] Each of three ranges of the power spectrum was four times larger for Parkinson’s disease patients than for the healthy groups (p {\textless} 0.05). The severity of Parkinson’s disease correlated significantly with the very low frequency range (0.01–0.05 Hz) of the power spectrum (r = 0.767, p = 0.0159) and the scaling factor βof the power spectrum (r = 0.850, p = 0.0037).

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a nonparametric method to estimate the spectrum of a multivariate locally stationary process. The time-varying spectrum is assumed to be smooth in both time and frequency. In order to ensure that the ﬁnal estimate of the multivariate spectrum is positive deﬁnite while allowing enough ﬂexibility in estimating each of its elements, we propose to smooth the Cholesky decomposition of an initial spectral estimate and to reconstruct the ﬁnal spectral estimate from the smoothed Cholesky elements. We propose a two-stage estimation procedure. The ﬁrst stage approximates the locally stationary process by a piecewise stationary time series to obtain the local estimate of the time varying spectrum and its Cholesky decomposition on discrete time-frequency points. The second stage uses a smoothing spline ANOVA to jointly smooth each Cholesky element in both time and frequency, and reconstructs the ﬁnal estimate of the time varying multivariate spectrum for any time-frequency point. The ﬁnal estimate is a smooth function in time and frequency, has a global interpretation, and is consistent and positive deﬁnite. We show that the Cholesky decomposition of a time varying spectrum can be used as a transfer function to generate a locally stationary time series with the designed spectrum. This not only provides us ﬂexibility in simulations, but also allows us to construct bootstrap conﬁdence intervals on the time varying multivariate spectrum. A simulation is conducted to investigate its performance and an application to an EEG data set recorded during an epileptic seizure is used as an illustration.},

A class of adaptive search procedures called genetic algorithms (GA) has been used to optimize a wide variety of complex systems. GA's are applied to the second level task of identifying efficient GA's for a set of numerical optimization problems. The results are validated on an image registration problem. GA's are shown to be effective for both levels of the systems optimization problem.},

	abstract = {Genetic algorithm (GA) is an artiﬁcial intelligence search method that uses the process of evolution and natural selection theory and is under the umbrella of evolutionary computing algorithm. It is an efﬁcient tool for solving optimization problems. Integration among (GA) parameters is vital for successful (GA) search. Such parameters include mutation and crossover rates in addition to population that are important issues in (GA). However, each operator of GA has a special and different inﬂuence. The impact of these factors is inﬂuenced by their probabilities; it is difﬁcult to predeﬁne speciﬁc ratios for each parameter, particularly, mutation and crossover operators. This paper reviews various methods for choosing mutation and crossover ratios in GAs. Next, we deﬁne new deterministic control approaches for crossover and mutation rates, namely Dynamic Decreasing of high mutation ratio/dynamic increasing of low crossover ratio (DHM/ILC), and Dynamic Increasing of Low Mutation/Dynamic Decreasing of High Crossover (ILM/DHC). The dynamic nature of the proposed methods allows the ratios of both crossover and mutation operators to be changed linearly during the search progress, where (DHM/ILC) starts with 100\% ratio for mutations, and 0\% for crossovers. Both mutation and crossover ratios start to decrease and increase, respectively. By the end of the search process, the ratios will be 0\% for mutations and 100\% for crossovers. (ILM/DHC) worked the same but the other way around. The proposed approach was compared with two parameters tuning methods (predeﬁned), namely ﬁfty-ﬁfty crossover/mutation ratios, and the most common approach that uses static ratios such as (0.03) mutation rates and (0.9) crossover rates. The experiments were conducted on ten Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP). The experiments showed the effectiveness of the proposed (DHM/ILC) when dealing with small population size, while the proposed (ILM/DHC) was found to be more effective when using large population size. In fact, both proposed dynamic methods outperformed the predeﬁned methods compared in most cases tested.},

An exceptional characteristic of PGAs is that they are not just the parallel version of a sequential algorithm intended to provide speed gains. Instead, they represent a new kind of meta-heuristics of higher efficiency and efficacy thanks to their structured population and parallel execution. The good robustness of these algorithms on problems of high complexity has led to an increasing number of applications in the fields of artificial intelligence, numeric and combinatorial optimization, business, engineering, etc. We make a formalization of these algorithms, and present a timely and topic survey of their most important traditional and recent technical issues.

We begin by reviewing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Milligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from cOrresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between -4-I.},

This approach can be divided broadly into two types namely supervised and unsupervised clustering. Motivated by human perception and Kohonen's method, we present a novel method of supervised clustering and classification using genetic algorithms. Clusters in the pattern space can be approximated by ellipses or sets of ellipses in two dimensions and ellipsoids in general, and the search for clusters can be approximated as the search for ellipsoids or sets of ellipsoids. By assigning fuzzy membership values to points in the pattern space a fuzzy ellipsoid is obtained. The process of thresholding which follows can be thought of as warping the contour of the ellipse to include and exclude certain points in pattern space and in effect producing an arbitrarily shaped cluster. Here we examine the use of genetic algorithms in generating fuzzy ellipsoids for learning the separation of the classes. Our evaluation function drives the genetic search towards the smallest ellipsoid or set of ellipsoids, which maximizes the number of correctly classified examples, and minimizes the number of misclassified examples.},

Many existing methods consider summaries of the time series obtained over a few well-known, pre-deﬁned frequency bands of interest. However, these methods do not provide data-driven methods for identifying frequency bands that optimally summarize frequency-domain information in the time series. A new method to identify partition points in the frequency space of a multivariate locally stationary time series is proposed. These partition points signify changes across frequencies in the time-varying behavior of the signal and provide frequency band summary measures that best preserve the nonstationary dynamics of the observed series. An L2 normbased discrepancy measure that ﬁnds diﬀerences in the time-varying spectral density matrix is constructed, and its asymptotic properties are derived.

We develop a scan statistic and search algorithm to detect changes in the frequency domain. We establish theoretical properties of this framework and develop a computationallyefﬁcient implementation.

Application of functional data clustering has appeared in many publications across various fields of sciences, including but not limited to biology, (bio)chemistry, engineering, environmental science, medical science, psychology, social science, and so on. The phenomenal growth of the application of functional data clustering indicates the urgent need for a systematic approach to develop efficient clustering methods and scalable algorithmic implementations. On the other hand, there is abundant literature on the cluster analysis of time series, trajectory data, spatio-temporal data, and so on, which are all related to functional data. Therefore, an overarching structure of existing functional data clustering methods will enable the cross-pollination of ideas across various research fields. We here conduct a comprehensive review of original clustering methods for functional data. We propose a systematic taxonomy that explores the connections and differences among the existing functional data clustering methods and relates them to the conventional multivariate clustering methods. The structure of the taxonomy is built on three main attributes of a functional data clustering method and therefore is more reliable than existing categorizations. The review aims to bridge the gap between the functional data analysis community and the clustering community and to generate new principles for functional data clustering.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have indicated that gait rhythm ﬂuctuations are useful for characterizing certain pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, no previous study has investigated the properties of frequency range distributions of gait rhythms. Therefore, in our study, empirical mode decomposition was implemented for decomposing the time series of gait rhythms into intrinsic mode functions from the high-frequency component to the low-frequency component sequentially. Then, Kendall’s coefﬁcient of concordance and the ratio for energy change for different IMFs were calculated, which were denoted as W and RE , respectively. Results revealed that the frequency distributions of gait rhythms in patients with neurodegenerative diseases are less homogeneous than healthy subjects, and the gait rhythms of the patients contain much more highfrequency components. In addition, parameters of W and RE can signiﬁcantly differentiate among the four groups of subjects (HD, ALS, PD, and healthy subjects) (with the minimum p-value of 0.0000493). Finally, ﬁve representative classiﬁers were utilized in order to evaluate the possible capabilities of W and RE to distinguish the patients with neurodegenerative diseases from the healthy subjects. This achieved maximum area under the curve values of 0.949, 0.900, and 0.934 for PD, HD, and ALS detection, respectively. In sum, our study suggests that gait rhythm features extracted in the frequency domain should be given consideration seriously in the future neurodegenerative disease characterization and intervention.},

The transfer function is composed of a deterministic component to account for the population-average effects and a random component to account for the unit-specific deviations. The resulting log-spectrum has a functional mixed effects representation where both the fixed effects and random effects are functions in the frequency domain. It is shown that, when the replicate-specific spectra are smooth, the log-periodograms converge to a functional mixed effects model. A data-driven iterative estimation procedure is offered for the periodic smoothing spline estimation of the fixed effects, penalized estimation of the functional covariance of the random effects, and unit-specific random effects prediction via the best linear unbiased predictor.},

In many applications, there exists variation in cyclical patterns from time series in the same group. Although a number of frequency domain methods for the discriminant analysis of time series have been explored, there is a dearth of models and methods that account for within‐group spectral variability. This article proposes a model for groups of time series in which transfer functions are modelled as stochastic variables that can account for both between‐group and within‐group differences in spectra that are identified from individual replicates. An ensuing discriminant analysis of stochastic cepstra under this model is developed to obtain parsimonious measures of relative power that optimally separate groups in the presence of within‐group spectral variability. The approach possesses favourable properties in classifying new observations and can be consistently estimated through a simple discriminant analysis of a finite number of estimated cepstral coefficients. Benefits in accounting for within‐group spectral variability are empirically illustrated in a simulation study and through an analysis of gait variability.},

	abstract = {This article considers the problem of analyzing associations between power spectra of multiple time series and cross-sectional outcomes when data are observed from multiple subjects. The motivating application comes from sleep medicine, where researchers are able to noninvasively record physiological time series signals during sleep. The frequency patterns of these signals, which can be quantified through the power spectrum, contain interpretable information about biological processes. An important problem in sleep research is drawing connections between power spectra of time series signals and clinical characteristics; these connections are key to understanding biological pathways through which sleep affects, and can be treated to improve, health. Such analyses are challenging as they must overcome the complicated structure of a power spectrum from multiple time series as a complex positive-definite matrix-valued function. This article proposes a new approach to such analyses based on a tensor-product spline model of Cholesky components of outcome-dependent power spectra. The approach flexibly models power spectra as nonparametric functions of frequency and outcome while preserving geometric constraints. Formulated in a fully Bayesian framework, a Whittle likelihood-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed for automated model fitting and for conducting inference on associations between outcomes and spectral measures. The method is used to analyze data from a study of sleep in older adults and uncovers new insights into how stress and arousal are connected to the amount of time one spends in bed.

During chronic stress, the sympathetic nervous system is hyperactivated, causing physical, psychological, and behavioral abnormalities. At present, there is no accepted standard for stress evaluation. This review aimed to survey studies providing a rationale for selecting heart rate variability (HRV) as a psychological stress indicator.
Methods Term searches in the Web of Science®, National Library of Medicine (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases yielded 37 publications meeting our criteria. The inclusion criteria were involvement of human participants, HRV as an objective psychological stress measure, and measured HRV reactivity.
Results In most studies, HRV variables changed in response to stress induced by various methods. The most frequently reported factor associated with variation in HRV variables was low parasympathetic activity, which is characterized by a decrease in the high-frequency band and an increase in the low-frequency band. Neuroimaging studies suggested that HRV may be linked to cortical regions (e.g., the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) that are involved in stressful situation appraisal.
Conclusion In conclusion, the current neurobiological evidence suggests that HRV is impacted by stress and supports its use for the objective assessment of psychological health and stress.},

	abstract = {Biomedical trials often give rise to data having the form of time series of a common process on separate individuals. One model which has been proposed to explain variations in such series across individuals is a random effects model based on sample periodograms. The use of spectral coefﬁcients enables models for individual series to be constructed on the basis of standard asymptotic theory, whilst variations between individuals are handled by permitting a random effect perturbation of model coefﬁcients. This paper extends such methodology in two ways: ﬁrst, by enabling a nonparametric speciﬁcation of underlying spectral behaviour; second, by addressing some of the tricky computational issues which are encountered when working with this class of random effect models. This leads to a model in which a population spectrum is speciﬁed nonparametrically through a dynamic system, and the processes measured on individuals within the population are assumed to have a spectrum which has a random effect perturbation from the population norm. Simulation studies show that standard MCMC algorithms give effective inferences for this model, and applications to biomedical data suggest that the model itself is capable of revealing scientiﬁcally important structure in temporal characteristics both within and between individual processes.},

In children of ∼3 yr of age, gait appears relatively mature; however, it is unknown whether the dynamics of walking change beyond this age.

To test this hypothesis, we measured the gait cycle duration on a stride-by-stride basis in 50 healthy 3- to 14-yr-old children (25 girls). Measurements of stride-to-stride variability were significantly larger both in the 3- and 4-yr-old children, compared with the 6- and 7-yr-old children, and in the 6- and 7-yr-old children, compared with the 11- to 14-yr-old children. Measurements of the temporal organization of gait also revealed significant age-dependent changes. The effects of age persisted even after adjusting for height. These findings indicate that mature stride dynamics may not be completely developed even in healthy 7-yr-old children and that different aspects of stride dynamics mature at different ages.},

	abstract = {The study of gait variability, the stride-to-stride fluctuations in walking, offers a complementary way of quantifying locomotion and its changes with aging and disease as well as a means of monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions and rehabilitation. Previous work has suggested that measures of gait variability may be more closely related to falls, a serious consequence of many gait disorders, than are measures based on the mean values of other walking parameters. The Current JNER series presents nine reports on the results of recent investigations into gait variability. One novel method for collecting unconstrained, ambulatory data is reviewed, and a primer on analysis methods is presented along with a heuristic approach to summarizing variability measures. In addition, the first studies of gait variability in animal models of neurodegenerative disease are described, as is a mathematical model of human walking that characterizes certain complex (multifractal) features of the motor control's pattern generator. Another investigation demonstrates that, whereas both healthy older controls and patients with a higher-level gait disorder walk more slowly in reduced lighting, only the latter's stride variability increases. Studies of the effects of dual tasks suggest that the regulation of the stride-to-stride fluctuations in stride width and stride time may be influenced by attention loading and may require cognitive input. Finally, a report of gait variability in over 500 subjects, probably the largest study of this kind, suggests how step width variability may relate to fall risk. Together, these studies provide new insights into the factors that regulate the stride-to-stride fluctuations in walking and pave the way for expanded research into the control of gait and the practical application of measures of gait variability in the clinical setting.},

            The basal ganglia are thought to play an important role in regulating motor programs involved in gait and in the fluidity and sequencing of movement. We postulated that the ability to maintain a steady gait, with low stride‐to‐stride variability of gait cycle timing and its subphases, would be diminished with both Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD). To test this hypothesis, we obtained quantitative measures of stride‐to‐stride variability of gait cycle timing in subjects with PD (n = 15), HD (n = 20), and disease‐free controls (n = 16). All measures of gait variability were significantly increased in PD and HD. In subjects with PD and HD, gait variability measures were two and three times that observed in control subjects, respectively. The degree of gait variability correlated with disease severity. In contrast, gait speed was significantly lower in PD, but not in HD, and average gait cycle duration and the time spent in many subphases of the gait cycle were similar in control subjects, HD subjects, and PD subjects. These findings are consistent with a differential control of gait variability, speed, and average gait cycle timing that may have implications for understanding the role of the basal ganglia in locomotor control and for quantitatively assessing gait in clinical settings.},

We hypothesized that subjects with ALS would have an altered gait rhythm, with an increase in both the magnitude of the stride-to-stride fluctuations and perturbations in the fluctuation dynamics. To test for this locomotor instability, we quantitatively compared the gait rhythm of subjects with ALS with that of normal controls and with that of subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD), pathologies of the basal ganglia. Subjects walked for 5 min at their usual pace wearing an ankle-worn recorder that enabled determination of the duration of each stride and of stride-to-stride fluctuations. We found that the gait of patients with ALS is less steady and more temporally disorganized compared with that of healthy controls. In addition, advanced ALS, HD, and PD were associated with certain common, as well as apparently distinct, features of altered stride dynamics. Thus stride-to-stride control of gait rhythm is apparently compromised with ALS. Moreover, a matrix of markers based on gait dynamics may be useful in characterizing certain pathologies of motor control and, possibly, in quantitatively monitoring disease progression and evaluating therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Background—Heart rate variability (HRV) differs markedly by race, yet few studies have evaluated these relationships in women. Moreover, none have evaluated HRV during sleep, despite sleep's importance to cardiovascular health.
Methods—We addressed these gaps by examining HRV during sleep in African American, Chinese and white women (mean age 51.2 ± 2.2). Sleep and HRV during sleep (sHRV) were measured concurrently.
Results—Heart rate variability during stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep differed significantly by race after adjusting for possible confounders. Normalized high frequency HRV was significantly lower in white compared to African American and Chinese participants (white NREM=0.35 ±.01, REM=0.23 ± .01; African American NREM=0.43 ± 0.02, REM=0.29 ± 0.02; Chinese NREM=0.47 ± 0.03, REM=0.33 ± 0.02; p’s{\textless}. 001). The inverse was seen for low frequency power, with higher values in white compared to African American and Chinese participants (white NREM=0.66 ± .01, REM=0.77 ± .01; African American=NREM 0.58 ± 0.02, REM=0.71 ± 0.02; Chinese=0.53 ± 0.03, REM=0.68 ± 0.02; p’s{\textless}. 010). Whites also exhibited higher low-to-high frequency HRV ratios during sleep compared to African American and Chinese women (white NREM=2.42 ± 1.07, REM=5.05 ± 1.07; African American NREM=1.69 ± 1.09, REM=3.51 ± 1.09; Chinese NREM=.35 ± 1.07, REM=2.88 ± 1.13; p’s{\textless}.001).
Conclusions—Race was robustly related to HRV during sleep. Compared to African American and Chinese women, whites exhibited decreased vagally-mediated control of the heart during sleep. Rresearch is needed to evaluate whether sHRV, including race differences, is prospectively associated with cardiovascular disease.},

The methodology is applied to two sets of data consisting of concentrations of luteinizing hormone in serial blood samples. For such data, the between-subject variability in periodogram ordinates at a given frequency is typically larger than would be implied by the usual asymptotic distribution theory for single series. We interpret this to mean that the underlying spectrum of the stochastic process representing the time variation in hormone concentration varies randomly between subjects. We describe simple random effects models to account for this extra variability and develop likelihood-based methods of inference, using a Monte Carlo integration method to evaluate the likelihood function. For our first data set, which comprises hormone concentrations in blood samples taken from eight subjects at 1 min intervals for 1 h, our model captures the qualitative behaviour of the between-subject variation in the spectrum. We conclude that there is a genuine high frequency component of variation in hormone concentrations and that the amplitude and frequency of this high frequency component vary between subjects. Our second data set relates to a similar sampling protocol, except that each subject is sampled before and after hormone replacement therapy. We conclude that this intervention has a significant effect on the spectrum.},

	abstract = {Gait analysis relies upon accurate measurement of initial and end foot contact times. These times act as a reference point for correlating all other gait data and as a means of distinguishing normal and pathologic gait. We have developed a simple, inexpensive footswitch systemthat provides accurate estimates of the start and end of stance phase for sequential steps. The estimates of the beginning and end of stance phase do not require custom footwear, extensive calibration, or precise placement of the sensor within the shoe. The system is based on a commercially available transducer and can be readily reproduced for use in a laboratory setting for lessthan \$50. We describe this system, aswell as its validation. To assessthe accuracy of this footswitch system, we compared footswitch based estimates of initial and end foot contact times with those obtained using a force platform as 10 people took 30 steps (10 each at slow, normal and fast walking rates) across a force platform. Both estimates coincided within + 10 ms (mean: 0 + 3 ms; N = 300) for the start of stance phase and within f 22 ms (mean: - 1+ 8 ms; N = 300) for the end of stance phase. For stance duration, the differences ranged from - 24 to 28 ms (mean: 1\&lo ms; N = 300). In combination, these measures can be used to estimate stance duration to within 3\% of force plate determined values for steps with stance durations ranging from 446 to 1594 ms. Estimates of swing and stride duration also are within 5\% of force plate determined values. This systemshould therefore prove to be a useful tool for augmenting laboratory based investigations of gait.},

	abstract = {The twenty-four hour sleep-wake pattern known as the rest-activity rhythm (RAR) is associated with many aspects of health and well-being. Researchers have utilized a number of interpretable, person-specific RAR measures that can be estimated from actigraphy. Actigraphs are wearable devices that dynamically record acceleration and provide indirect measures of physical activity over time. One class of useful RAR measures are those that quantify variability around a mean circadian pattern. However, current parametric and nonparametric RAR measures used by applied researchers can only quantify variability from a limited or undefined number of rhythmic sources. The primary goal of this article is to consider a new measure of RAR variability: the log-power spectrum of stochastic error around a circadian mean. This functional measure quantifies the relative contributions of variability about a circadian mean from all possibly frequencies, including weekly, daily, and high-frequency sources of variation. It can be estimated through a two-stage procedure that smooths the log-periodogram of residuals after estimating a circadian mean. The development of this measure was motivated by a study of depression in older adults and revealed that slow, rhythmic variations in activity from a circadian pattern are correlated with depression symptoms.},

	abstract = {Determining the optimal number of regions is a challenging issue in regionalization. Although cluster validity indices developed for non-spatial clustering have been used to determine the optimal number of regions, spatial contiguity constraints for regionalization are often neglected. Consequently, different regionalization results can share the same validity index value, which reduces the reliability of identifying the optimal number of regions in regionalization. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a spatially constrained statistical approach for determining the optimal number of regions using two metrics: (i) a permutation-based variance for measuring the homogeneity within regions and (ii) a proportion index based on spatially constrained k-nearest neighbors to quantify the separation between regions. Furthermore, a distance-based method is employed to balance these two metrics to automatically determine the optimal number of regions. Experimental results on five synthetic datasets, the US presidential election and climate datasets show that the statistical approach developed in this study outperforms three widely used cluster validity indices in determining the optimal number of regions. The proposed statistical approach is straightforward to implement and can effectively reduce subjectivity in regionalization.},

However, in high-dimensional regimes, naive estimates of the principal loadings are not consistent and difficult to interpret. In the context of time series, principal component analysis of spectral density matrices can provide valuable, parsimonious information about the behavior of the underlying process, particularly if the principal components are interpretable in that they are sparse in coordinates and localized in frequency bands. In this paper, we introduce a formulation and consistent estimation procedure for interpretable principal component analysis for high-dimensional time series in the frequency domain. An efficient frequency-sequential algorithm is developed to compute sparse-localized estimates of the low-dimensional principal subspaces of the signal process. The method is motivated by and used to understand neurological mechanisms from high-density resting-state EEG in a study of first episode psychosis.},

Among methods for clustering, hierarchical approaches have enjoyed substantial popularity in genomics and other fields for their ability to simultaneously uncover multiple layers of clustering structure. A critical and challenging question in cluster analysis is whether the identified clusters represent important underlying structure or are artifacts of natural sampling variation. Few approaches have been proposed for addressing this problem in the context of hierarchical clustering, for which the problem is further complicated by the natural tree structure of the partition, and the multiplicity of tests required to parse the layers of nested clusters. In this paper, we propose a Monte Carlo based approach for testing statistical significance in hierarchical clustering which addresses these issues. The approach is implemented as a sequential testing procedure guaranteeing control of the family-wise error rate. Theoretical justification is provided for our approach, and its power to detect true clustering structure is illustrated through several simulation studies and applications to two cancer gene expression datasets.},

Altered fractal dynamics of gait: reduced stride-interval correlations with aging and Huntington’s disease. J. Appl. Physiol. 82(1): 262–269, 1997.—Fluctuations in the duration of the gait cycle (the stride interval) display fractal dynamics and long-range correlations in healthy young adults. We hypothesized that these stride-interval correlations would be altered by changes in neurological function associated with aging and certain disease states. To test this hypothesis, we compared the stride-interval time series of 1) healthy elderly subjects and young controls and of 2) subjects with Huntington’s disease and healthy controls. Using detrended fluctuation analysis, we computed α, a measure of the degree to which one stride interval is correlated with previous and subsequent intervals over different time scales. The scaling exponent α was significantly lower in elderly subjects compared with young subjects (elderly: 0.68 ± 0.14; young: 0.87 ± 0.15; P {\textless} 0.003). The scaling exponent α was also smaller in the subjects with Huntington’s disease compared with disease-free controls (Huntington’s disease: 0.60 ± 0.24; controls: 0.88 ± 0.17; P {\textless} 0.005). Moreover, α was linearly related to degree of functional impairment in subjects with Huntington’s disease ( r = 0.78, P {\textless} 0.0005). These findings demonstrate that stride-interval fluctuations are more random (i.e., less correlated) in elderly subjects and in subjects with Huntington’s disease. Abnormal alterations in the fractal properties of gait dynamics are apparently associated with changes in central nervous system control.},

	abstract = {Objective: Two strategies are known for turning while walking: step turns (the direction change is performed with 3 steps or more) and spin turns (turning on one/both feet simultaneously). It is unknown which strategy patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) choose and if L-dopa and STN-DBS are influencing this strategy.
Methods: Video-recordings of 171 PD patients that completed 180° turns were analyzed by two blinded raters before surgery, both off and on L-dopa, and one year after STN-DBS-implantation. The strategies were classified: 1) spin 2) step and 3) mixed (spin plus step) strategy. The characteristics of the patients with different strategies were compared.
Results: Interrater reliability for classification of turning strategy showed high agreement (κ = 0.894). The distribution of the preferred strategy differed significantly between treatment conditions (untreated, treated with L-dopa, L-dopa plus stimulation; X2(4) = 67.2, p {\textless} 0.0001). The spin turn was found in 10.5\% of patients OFF-drug, 23.5\% ON-drug and in 38.8\% ON-drug/ON-stim condition. In the three treatment conditions patients with spin turns had significantly lower UPDRS III scores compared to people with step turns (p = 0.017, p = 0.001, p = 0.006, respectively); step turn patients had poorer postural instability and gait disorders (PIGD) scores (p = 0.04, p = 0.002, p = 0.04, respectively).
Conclusion: The turn strategy can be reliably identified in clinical settings and is a simple motor sign. The spin turn is associated with better motor performance. Since improvements in motor score in patients with fluctuations are also related to behavioral changes, we cannot exclude that the turn strategy also represents a feature of psycho-motor interaction.},

              Accurate and efficient detection of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is critical to ensure proper treatment for affected individuals. Current clinical examinations, however, are inefficient and prone to misdiagnosis, as they rely on qualitative observations of perceived behavior. We propose a robust machine learning based framework that analyzes pupil-size dynamics as an objective biomarker for the automated detection of ADHD. Our framework integrates a comprehensive pupillometric feature engineering and visualization pipeline with state-of-the-art binary classification algorithms and univariate feature selection. The support vector machine classifier achieved an average 85.6\% area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), 77.3\% sensitivity, and 75.3\% specificity using ten-fold nested cross-validation (CV) on a declassified dataset of 50 patients. 218 of the 783 engineered features, including fourier transform metrics, absolute energy, consecutive quantile changes, approximate entropy, aggregated linear trends, as well as pupil-size dilation velocity, were found to be statistically significant differentiators (
              p
              {\textless} 0.05), and provide novel behavioral insights into associations between pupil-size dynamics and the presence of ADHD. Despite a limited sample size, the strong AUROC values highlight the robustness of the binary classifiers in detecting ADHD—as such, with additional data, sensitivity and specificity metrics can be substantially augmented. This study is the first to apply machine learning based methods for the detection of ADHD using solely pupillometrics, and highlights its strength as a potential discriminative biomarker, paving the path for the development of novel diagnostic applications to aid in the detection of ADHD using oculometric paradigms and machine learning.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new approach, called Isolate-Detect (ID), for the consistent estimation of the number and location of multiple generalized change-points in noisy data sequences. Examples of signal changes that ID can deal with are changes in the mean of a piecewise-constant signal and changes, continuous or not, in the linear trend. The number of change-points can increase with the sample size. Our method is based on an isolation technique, which prevents the consideration of intervals that contain more than one change-point. This isolation enhances ID’s accuracy as it allows for detection in the presence of frequent changes of possibly small magnitudes. In ID, model selection is carried out via thresholding, or an information criterion, or SDLL, or a hybrid involving the former two. The hybrid model selection leads to a general method with very good practical performance and minimal parameter choice. In the scenarios tested, ID is at least as accurate as the state-of-the-art methods; most of the times it outperforms them. ID is implemented in the R packages IDetect and breakfast, available from CRAN.},

Recently these techniques were applied in the area of industrial engineering; the most-known applications include scheduling and sequencing in manufacturing systems, computer-aided design, facility layout and location problems, distribution and transportation problems, and many others. Industrial engineering problems usually are quite hard to solve due to a high complexity of the objective functions and a significant number of problem-specific constraints; often an algorithm to solve such problems requires incorporation of some heuristic methods. In this paper we concentrate on constraint handling heuristics for evolutionary computation techniques. This general discussion is followed by three test case studies: truss structure optimization problem, design of a composite laminated plate, and the unit commitment problem. These are typical highly constrained engineering problems and the methods discussed here are directly transferrable to industrial engineering problems.},

	abstract = {This paper is focused on the concise review of the speciﬁc applications of genetic algorithms in forecasting commodity prices. Genetic algorithms seem relevant in this ﬁeld for many reasons. For instance, they lack the necessity to assume a certain statistical distribution, and they are efﬁcient in dealing with non-stationary data. Indeed, the latter case is very frequent while forecasting the commodity prices of, for example, crude oil. Moreover, growing interest in their application has been observed recently. In parallel, researchers are also interested in constructing hybrid genetic algorithms (i.e., joining them with other econometric methods). Such an approach helps to reduce each of the individual method ﬂaws and yields promising results. In this article, three groups of commodities are discussed: energy commodities, metals, and agricultural products. The advantages and disadvantages of genetic algorithms and their hybrids are presented, and further conclusions concerning their possible improvements and other future applications are discussed. This article ﬁlls a signiﬁcant literature gap, focusing on particular ﬁnancial and economic applications. In particular, it combines three important—yet not often jointly discussed—topics: genetic algorithms, their hybrids with other tools, and commodity price forecasting issues.},
